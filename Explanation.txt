N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. 
A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.
The people and seats are represented by an integer from 0 to 2N-1, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being (0, 1), the second couple being (2, 3), and 
so on with the last couple being (2N-2, 2N-1).
The couples' initial seating is given by row[i] being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.

Input Description:
First line contains, N the size of row. (1<N<1000)
Second line contains, N size of elements as integers.

Output Description:
Print the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side.
